### Vector manipulation in the Assembly Pep/9 language.
Designed and implemented a program in assembly to manipulate integer arrays, including operations such as
printing, left/right rotation, and exchanging elements.

## Functions

Signatures written in C
style for readability):

1. ```inVect(int size, int[] vector)```
Constructs a vector of integers
of size 'size' where each
integer is entered by the user.

2. ```prinVect(int size, int[] vector)```
Prints vector entered by the user.

3. ```rotLeft(int size, int[] vector)```
Rotates the input vector left by
one position.

4. ```rotRight(int size, int[] vector)```
Rotates the input vector right by
one position.

5. ```exchange(int loc1, int loc2, int size, int[] vector)```
Exchanges 2 elements in the input
vector based on their locations.

6. ```main()```
Driver code for the whole program.
